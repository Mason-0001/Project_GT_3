Storm Chasers tornado analysis

The storm chasers team for this project was made up of 4 members: Mason Portman, Jack Fitzgerald, Pris Briggs, & Libby Berter.

We developed a web app to cover some basic overview information about tornados and included 2 visuslaization pages.
The overview page included a link to the original tornado database, a description of a tornado, a chart of the EF scale, and an 
astonishing video captured of a tornado destroying a small town.

The 1st visualization page included a map detailing tornados for a selected year including markers that varied in color & size 
based on the EF scale and the length the tornado traveled.  Also included in the map section were overlays of a heat map as well 
as visuals of the tornado paths based on the starting lat/long coordinates and the ending coordinates.

The charts page included a table with statistics for the selected year and 2 bar charts.  The data for each bar chart could be 
changed from # of tornados/year, the avg strength, and the property loss/year.  The top chart shows the top 15 states that year 
and the bottom chart shows the history of time since 2007
